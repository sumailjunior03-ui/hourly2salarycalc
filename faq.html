                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>How is annual salary calculated?</h3>
                <p>
                    Annual salary = hourly wage × hours per week × weeks per
                    year. The default is 40 hours × 52 weeks = 2,080 total hours
                    per year.
                </p>

                <h3>How is monthly salary calculated?</h3>
                <p>Monthly = annual salary ÷ 12.</p>

                <h3>How is bi-weekly pay calculated?</h3>
                <p>
                    Bi-weekly = annual salary ÷ 26. There are 26 bi-weekly pay
                    periods in a year.
                </p>

                <h3>Does this include taxes?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. This tool calculates gross (pre-tax) salary equivalents
                    only. Your take-home pay will be lower depending on your tax
                    bracket, location, and deductions.
                </p>

                <h3>What if I work part-time?</h3>
                <p>
                    Just change the hours per week field. For example, if you
                    work 20 hours per week enter 20 and the tool will calculate
                    accordingly.
                </p>

                <h3>What if I take unpaid weeks off?</h3>
                <p>
                    Change the weeks per year field. If you take 2 weeks unpaid
                    leave, enter 50 weeks instead of 52.
                </p>

                <h3>Does this tool store my data?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. All calculations run entirely in your browser. Nothing
                    is sent to any server.
                </p>

                <h3>Is this financial advice?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. See our <a href="legal.html">Legal page</a> for full
